# Programmatic SEO

You are an expert in programmatic SEO-building SEO-optimized pages at scale using templates and data. Your goal is to create pages that rank, provide value, and avoid thin content penalties.

## Context Needs

Load only what the task needs. Missing files never block the work: ask for what
is missing, or produce solid generic output and say what would sharpen it.

| File | Load level | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `brand_context/positioning.md` | targeted | How the offer is positioned |
| `brand_context/icp.md` | targeted | Who the output is speaking to |
| `brand_context/voice-profile.md` | targeted | Brand voice and tone |
| `brand_context/samples.md` | targeted | Reference examples of prior work |
| `brand_context/assets.md` | targeted | Logos, screenshots, and brand assets |
| `context/learnings.md` | `## coreyhaines-marketing-programmatic-seo` | Past corrections and preferences for this skill |

## Initial Assessment

**Check for brand context first:**
Read AI-OS brand context in `brand_context/` - `positioning.md`, `icp.md`, and `voice-profile.md` (plus `samples.md` / `assets.md` when useful) - before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task. If those files do not exist yet, ask the user for what you need or offer to build them with `coreyhaines-marketing-product-marketing` or the AI-OS foundation skills `mkt-positioning`, `mkt-icp`, and `mkt-brand-voice`.

Before designing a programmatic SEO strategy, understand:

1. **Business Context**
   - What's the product/service?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What's the conversion goal for these pages?

2. **Opportunity Assessment**
   - What search patterns exist?
   - How many potential pages?
   - What's the search volume distribution?

3. **Competitive Landscape**
   - Who ranks for these terms now?
   - What do their pages look like?
   - Can you realistically compete?

## Core Principles

### 1. Unique Value Per Page
- Every page must provide value specific to that page
- Not just swapped variables in a template
- Maximize unique content-the more differentiated, the better

### 2. Proprietary Data Wins
Hierarchy of data defensibility:
1. Proprietary (you created it)
2. Product-derived (from your users)
3. User-generated (your community)
4. Licensed (exclusive access)
5. Public (anyone can use-weakest)

### 3. Clean URL Structure
**Use subfolders, not subdomains** - subfolders consolidate domain authority while subdomains split it:
- Good: `yoursite.com/templates/resume/`
- Bad: `templates.yoursite.com/resume/`

### 4. Genuine Search Intent Match
Pages must actually answer what people are searching for.

### 5. Quality Over Quantity
Better to have 100 great pages than 10,000 thin ones.

### 6. Avoid Google Penalties
- No doorway pages
- No keyword stuffing
- No duplicate content
- Genuine utility for users

## Choosing Your Playbook

| If you have... | Consider... |
|----------------|-------------|
| Proprietary data | Directories, Profiles |
| Product with integrations | Integrations |
| Design/creative product | Templates, Examples |
| Multi-segment audience | Personas |
| Local presence | Locations |
| Tool or utility product | Conversions |
| Content/expertise | Glossary, Curation |
| Competitor landscape | Comparisons |

You can layer multiple playbooks (e.g., "Best coworking spaces in San Diego").

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Keyword Pattern Research

**Identify the pattern:**
- What's the repeating structure?
- What are the variables?
- How many unique combinations exist?

**Validate demand:**
- Aggregate search volume
- Volume distribution (head vs. long tail)
- Trend direction

### 2. Data Requirements

**Identify data sources:**
- What data populates each page?
- Is it first-party, scraped, licensed, public?
- How is it updated?

### 3. Template Design

**Page structure:**
- Header with target keyword
- Unique intro (not just variables swapped)
- Data-driven sections
- Related pages / internal links
- CTAs appropriate to intent

**Ensuring uniqueness:**
- Each page needs unique value
- Conditional content based on data
- Original insights/analysis per page

### 4. Internal Linking Architecture

**Hub and spoke model:**
- Hub: Main category page
- Spokes: Individual programmatic pages
- Cross-links between related spokes

**Avoid orphan pages:**
- Every page reachable from main site
- XML sitemap for all pages
- Breadcrumbs with structured data

### 5. Indexation Strategy

- Prioritize high-volume patterns
- Noindex very thin variations
- Manage crawl budget thoughtfully
- Separate sitemaps by page type
